## Which topology

<!-- Which topology does this example demonstrate? (e.g., Parallel Explorers, Feature Pod) -->

## Scenario

<!-- Describe the real context. What repo? What were you trying to accomplish? What constraints existed? -->

## Setup

<!-- How did you create the team? Include spawn prompts, agent count, model choices, and any configuration. -->

**Team size:**
**Models used:**
**Spawn prompt(s):**

```
(paste spawn prompts here)
```

## What happened

<!-- Timestamped narrative of how the work actually progressed. Be specific. -->

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 0:00 | |
| | |
| | |

## What went wrong

<!-- Be honest. Coordination failures, context issues, wrong decomposition, wasted tokens -- all valuable. If nothing went wrong, explain what you got lucky on. -->

## Results

<!-- Concrete metrics -->

- **Wall-clock duration:**
- **Total tokens used:**
- **Estimated cost:**
- **Outcome:** (e.g., "PR merged", "3 of 4 tasks completed", "abandoned after X")

## Retrospective

<!-- What would you do differently next time? What advice would you give someone running this topology for the first time? -->
